                    I'm a twenty-nine-year-old <em>almost</em> Arizona native with an intense passion for coding, making the world a better place, The Arizona Diamondbacks, deep conversations, learning, and any and all food. Literally - I'll eat anything but fried liver. I was born in Spokane, WA, but spent a mere three days in my birthplace, moving to the Phoenix area at four days old. After bouncing around the valley for five years I settled in Scottsdale, where I'm proud to say I've been ever since.

                    During the day I build trusses at a north Phoenix Lumber company, managing <em>simple</em> slope equations throughout the entire shift, all the while dreaming of writing <em>complex</em> programs destined to change the web in its own little way - or BIG.
